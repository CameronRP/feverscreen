# thermal-recorder

This software is used by The Cacophony Project to record thermal video
footage from a FLIR Lepton 3 camera when a warm moving object
(hopefully an animal) is detected. Recordings are stored using the
project's own CPTV format.

## Releases

Releases are built using TravisCI. To create a release visit the
[repository on Github](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/thermal-recorder/releases)
and then follow our [general instructions](https://docs.cacophony.org.nz/home/creating-releases)
for creating a release.

For more about the mechanics of how releases work, see `.travis.yml` and `.goreleaser.yml`.
